						Hello! My name is Dan. I am from the Bay Area originally but I have
						spent most of my life along the I5 corridor in Oregon. I grew up
						playing video games with my brother and I have had a lifelong
						fascination with technology. As a child I also loved to write
						stories. These creative impulses led me to initially pursue theatre
						and music in college. Despite this, surprisingly, I graduated with a
						degree in French. When that proved to be a futile career path I went
						back to college to learn more about computers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Programming seemed the natural avenue for all of my interests but I
						didn't have the math credits to get in to the Computer Science
						program. I got an Associate's in Computer Information Systems
						instead. That put me on track for over a decade in the tech support
						and IT fields. While I enjoy my current career, it doesn't scratch
						my creative itch.
					</p>
					<p>
						I recognize that no matter what job I have, there will be days that
						I hate. Rather than chase a dream job only to experience the
						disappointment of realizing that I hate it (sometimes) I want to
						pursue work that satisfies me. When I enjoy what I <em>do</em>, I
						can find fulfillment in my day even when I would rather be buried in
						my sheets. I love making things. I love solving problems. Most of
						all I love having concrete proof of my effort at the end of a long
						day. Coding is all of those things.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of work I still love video games and music but I don't have
						much time for them these days. I live in Milwaukie, Oregon with my
						wife, two kids, two dogs, and one obnoxious cat.
					</p>
