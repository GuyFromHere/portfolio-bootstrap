					Hello! My name is Dan. I am from the Bay Area originally but I have
					spent most of my life along the I5 corridor in Oregon. I grew up
					playing video games with my brother and I have had a lifelong
					fascination with technology. As a child I also loved to write stories.
					These creative impulses led me to initially pursue theatre and music
					in college. Despite this, surprisingly, I graduated with a degree in
					French. When that proved to be a futile career path I went back to
					college to learn more about computers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Programming seemed the natural avenue for all of my interests but I
					didn't have the math credits to get in to the Computer Science
					program. I got an Associate's in Computer Information Systems instead.
					That put me on track for over a decade in the tech support and IT
					fields. While I enjoy my current career, it doesn't scratch my
					creative itch.
				</p>
				<p>
					I recognize that no matter what job I have, there will be days that I
					hate. Rather than chase a dream job only to experience the
					disappointment of realizing that I hate it (sometimes) I want to
					pursue work that satisfies me. When I enjoy what I <em>do</em>, I can
					find fulfillment in my day even when I would rather be buried in my
					sheets. I love making things. I love solving problems. Most of all I
					love having concrete proof of my effort at the end of a long day.
					Coding is all of those things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of work I still love video games and music but I don't have
					much time for them these days. I live in Milwaukie, Oregon with my
					wife, two kids, two dogs, and one obnoxious cat.
