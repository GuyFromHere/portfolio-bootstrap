# portfolio-bootstrap

## Description 

This is the portfolio project with Bootstrap. Per the requirements of the assignment I tried to avoid using media queries as much as possible. I also tried to avoid overriding the custom Bootstrap classes because that seemed to defeat the purpose of using Bootstrap in the first place! As a result I relied mostly on the built in responsive sizing and spacing classes. I think it could have been more faithful to the spec pics if I used media queries but I learned a lot about Bootstrap because of those constraints.
